# Vision Document: Telecom RAG Planning & Reasoning Agent

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an intelligent planning and reasoning agent that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to assist telecom customers in making informed decisions about their service plans and addressing various queries.

## Core Vision

**Mission**: Create a sophisticated AI-powered assistant that can understand customer needs, analyze telecom offerings, and provide personalized recommendations by combining real-time knowledge retrieval with intelligent reasoning capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Telecom customers face significant challenges when:
- Navigating complex plan structures with multiple variables (data limits, speeds, pricing tiers)
- Understanding which plan best fits their usage patterns and budget
- Comparing features across different service offerings
- Getting timely support for plan changes, billing questions, and technical issues
- Making sense of promotional offers and contract terms

## Solution Architecture

### Knowledge Base Construction
- **Web Scraping**: Systematically crawl and extract information from the telecom provider's website
- **Data Processing**: Structure and normalize plan details, pricing, features, and policy information
- **Vector Storage**: Convert textual information into embeddings for efficient semantic search
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement mechanisms to keep the knowledge base current with website changes

### Planning & Reasoning Engine
- **Customer Profiling**: Analyze user inputs to understand usage patterns, preferences, and constraints
- **Multi-criteria Decision Making**: Evaluate plans across dimensions like cost, data allowance, network coverage, and special features
- **Contextual Reasoning**: Consider customer history, location, and specific requirements
- **Recommendation Generation**: Provide ranked suggestions with clear explanations

## Key Features

### Customer Query Handling
- **Plan Recommendations**: "Which plan is best for my family of 4 with heavy streaming usage?"
- **Cost Analysis**: "What would my monthly bill be if I switch to unlimited data?"
- **Feature Comparison**: "Compare 5G coverage between Plan A and Plan B in my area"
- **Usage Optimization**: "How can I reduce my monthly bill without losing important features?"

### Intelligent Capabilities
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Process complex, conversational queries
- **Context Awareness**: Remember conversation history and customer preferences
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Identify cost-saving opportunities or plan upgrades
- **Explanation Generation**: Provide clear reasoning behind recommendations

## Technical Components

### RAG Pipeline
1. **Document Ingestion**: Automated web scraping and content extraction
2. **Text Processing**: Cleaning, chunking, and preprocessing of telecom content
3. **Embedding Generation**: Convert text chunks to vector representations
4. **Vector Database**: Store and index embeddings for fast retrieval
5. **Retrieval System**: Find relevant information based on user queries
6. **Generation Engine**: Combine retrieved context with LLM capabilities

### Planning Algorithm
- **Goal Identification**: Extract customer objectives from natural language
- **Constraint Analysis**: Identify budget limits, feature requirements, and preferences
- **Option Evaluation**: Score available plans against customer criteria
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Explain compromises and alternatives
- **Recommendation Ranking**: Order suggestions by suitability score

## Success Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- **Query Resolution Rate**: Percentage of customer questions answered accurately
- **Recommendation Accuracy**: How often customers accept suggested plans
- **Response Time**: Average time to generate helpful responses
- **Knowledge Freshness**: Currency of information relative to website updates

### User Experience
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Post-interaction ratings and feedback
- **Engagement Metrics**: Session duration and query complexity handled
- **Conversion Rate**: Queries leading to plan changes or purchases
- **Support Deflection**: Reduction in human agent escalations

- Add conversation memory and context tracking
- Implement proactive recommendation features
- Optimize performance and accuracy

### Phase 4: Production (Weeks 13-16)
- Deploy production-ready system
- Implement monitoring and analytics
- Add real-time knowledge base updates
- Conduct user testing and refinement

## Technology Stack Considerations

### Core Technologies
- **Web Scraping**: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Playwright
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, or local models
- **Embedding Models**: OpenAI embeddings or sentence-transformers
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI, Flask, or Streamlit

### Data Management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching
- **Queue System**: Celery for background tasks
- **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics collection, and alerting systems

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Quality**: Implement validation and quality checks for scraped content
- **Website Changes**: Build robust parsing with change detection
- **Scalability**: Design for growth in data volume and user queries
- **Accuracy**: Establish testing frameworks and human-in-the-loop validation

### Business Risks
- **Compliance**: Ensure recommendations align with telecom regulations
- **Privacy**: Protect customer data and query information
- **Reliability**: Build fault-tolerant systems with graceful degradation
- **Bias**: Regular auditing of recommendations for fairness

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Multi-modal Input**: Support for images, documents, and voice queries
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast customer needs and usage patterns
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with billing systems and account management
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience for on-the-go assistance

### Intelligence Evolution
- **Learning Capabilities**: Improve recommendations based on user feedback
- **Personalization**: Deeper customer modeling and preference learning
- **Proactive Outreach**: Notify customers of better plan options
- **Market Analysis**: Compare offerings across multiple telecom providers
